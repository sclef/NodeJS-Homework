       "description":"WASHINGTON (AP) — As the partial government shutdown slipped into the record books, members of Congress had left town, no negotiations were scheduled and President Donald Trump tweeted into the void. The president did not tip his hand Saturday on whether he will move ahead with an emergency declaration that could break the impasse, free up money for his wall without congressional approval and kick off legal challenges and a political storm over the use of that extraordinary step. A day earlier, he said he was not ready to do it \"right now.\"",

But if you're a sportsman looking to hunt game, a gas company planning to drill offshore or a taxpayer awaiting your refund, you're in luck: This shutdown won't affect your plans.",

(AP) — A day after its officers went without a paycheck for the first time during the government shutdown, the Transportation Security Administration drew in almost 200 people still interested in the airport security job during a fast-track hiring event Saturday in Tennessee. Joshua Paders, a 31-year-old who attended the event, said he would still take a TSA position if he's hired and the government remains shut down and he wouldn't be getting a paycheck right away. \"It just shows that I'm willing to work, that I really want to do it,\" said Paders, who said he's worked in multiple security jobs and always viewed TSA as a good opportunity.",

Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun smiled broadly as she exited an airport arrival door sporting a Canada zipper hoodie and a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees hat, capping a dramatic week that saw her flee her family while visiting Kuwait and before flying to Bangkok. Once there, she barricaded herself in an airport hotel to avoid deportation and tweeted about her situation.",

Now Syrian President Bashar Assad is poised to be readmitted to the fold of Arab nations, a feat once deemed unthinkable as he forcefully crushed the uprising against his family's rule. Gulf Arab nations, once the main backers of rebels trying to oust Assad, are lining up to reopen their embassies in Syria, worried about leaving the country at the heart of the Arab world to regional rivals Iran and Turkey and missing out on lucrative post-war reconstructive projects. Key border crossings with neighbors, shuttered for years by the war, have reopened, and Arab commercial airlines are reportedly considering resuming flights to Damascus.",

The development sets the stage for a climax to one of Italy's longest-running efforts to bring a fugitive to justice. Bolivian police, working with Italian agents, arrested Battisti, 64, overnight in Santa Cruz de La Sierra, Italian police said. He had been living in Brazil for years, but last month Brazil's outgoing president signed a decree ordering his extradition, apparently sparking Battisti's latest flight.",
